Objective:
Provide a C++ library to solve all mate_in_one puzzles in inputs/mate_in_one.pgn

Plan:
1. Create protobuf representation of chess game state.
Comment: Why not simply use the pgn representation which is compact too?

2. Create input reader lib.

3. Code rules for determining if a given state is Mated.

4. Code rules for legal moves.
